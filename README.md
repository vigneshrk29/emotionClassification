Classification of emotion from gait


This is using the code from TSAI and STEP(Spatial-temporal emotion classification). Emotion classification is done using an FCN model (Wang 2016) paper. It is currently trained on the Emotion dataset. 


To run, just run the FCN_STEP file. You would need to have the tsai installed as well as the supporting libraries for STEP.
